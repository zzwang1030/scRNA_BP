R scripts for the analysis of Single-cell RNA sequencing data of Bullous Pemphigoid link to " ***** "(cited will be added here when this study published).

All softwares used in this study are commercially or freely available.

The bioinformatics steps mentioned in the Method section, including single-cell preparation, RNA sequencing, and data analysis was included in Single-cell_RNA_sequencing_data_analysis.r.
The code responsible to generate Figure1-6, supplementary figures 1-5,7 and 10-14 were included in their respective files such as Rscript_link_to_Fig1.r, Rscript_link_to_Fig2.r, Rscript_link_to_Fig3.r, and so on.

Please note that some files,due to their size exceeding 25MB, cannot be uploaded here. This includes the 'gene_cell_exprs_table_symbol.xls' file. You may generate it yourself using the raw data provided in 10X Genomics format, accessible at zenodo (https://zenodo.org/records/10924853), or alternativerly, you can request these files from the corresponding author.
